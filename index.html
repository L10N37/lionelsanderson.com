                  A true multiregion solution for the iconic Playstation 1 console, I coded a simple program using the adafruit library and arduino C++ to sense
                  a signal pin and switch the frequencies provided to the Graphics Processing Unit dependent on the game region / BIOS region of the console.

            <p>This project is a work-in-progress Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator. Users can load a game ROM for the system and step through its instructions until 
              they reach one that hasn't been implemented yet. While doing so, they can observe RAM allocations and multiple register bit updates, with pertinent information 
              displayed at each step. The screen size can be adjusted, and the emulator can simulate vintage CRT effects. I incorporated transparency using layers and a test image, 
              enabling users to experience classic CRT television effects such as scanlines and grilles. There's an option to select from various backgrounds; the app saves your 
              preference locally and retrieves it upon reopening.
              <br>
              This emulator is a JavaScript adaptation of a program I initially developed in C++.</p>

            <p>When transferring games from the Playstation 2 to your PC, they typically save under their game ID instead of the game title. My application streamlines this process. 
              You simply place a provided database text file (which will be updated as needed) in the same directory as my C++ application. The app scans its directory for all ISO files 
              and generates a 'work list' text file with this data. It then examines specific locations within the ISO files that indicate where the disc's files are located. Subsequently, 
              the app loads a particular file's contents into RAM as a variable, searches for the GAMEID, references the GAMEID in the database, and renames the ISO file using the corresponding 
              game title. The program is configured to process and rename up to 1,000 images nearly instantaneously in this manner.
              <br>
              Developing this tool necessitated research into the ISO-9660 file system used for optical disc media.</p>

              <h3>UberNee / UberChip</h3>
              <br>
            </a>
            <p>UberChip began as a timing-based modchip designed to circumvent the original Sony Playstation's security and region locks. Although there were several iterations, 
              a timing-based UberChip would achieve, at best, 99% compatibility with the entire software library for the system. I then sought to develop a modchip that would be 
              fully compatible with the entire software library, but with unique enhancements. This led to the creation of UberNee, a complete rewrite of PSNEE V7 with my personal 
              improvements. It doesn't waste time during boot-up to verify the system it's installed in, and it provides an additional signal that some systems need. 
              Users can choose to either wire this up or omit it. Its code is cleaner, more readable, and allows for straightforward adjustments prior to flashing by merely tweaking 
              a few variables to account for region selection and drive wear levels. UberNee also offers a debug screen, enabling users to monitor events live in a development setting. 
              The chip is compatible with all console revisions, with extra region unlock features for specific system models with a restricted BIOS. Initially written for the Atmega 328P, 
              UberNee was later aimed at the LGT8F328P, a more cost-effective alternative at that time. Specific libraries were selected to achieve accurate timing. 
              The final version is adaptable and can work with either microcontroller. The chip is coded in C++ and utilises the Arduino IDE. Additionally, there's a PIC version of UberNee 
              tailored for 12F628A and 12F675 microcontrollers, crafted using the bare assembly language detailed in the datasheet/s. This PIC version also supports the installation of status 
              LEDs to indicate which of the 3 chip modes is active.</p>

              <h3>SNES / Super Famicom In Game Reset</h3>
              <br>
            </a>
            <p>I was curious about the communication protocol of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) / Super Famicom, so I turned to Google. Using the information I found, without 
              the need for personal signal analysis, I swiftly wrote a C++ program that enables users to reset the console directly from the controllerâ€”a feature absent in the original design. 
              This functionality proves particularly useful nowadays for multi-game cartridges, allowing users to return to the game selection menu without physically interacting with the console. 
              I later revised the program to include the option of connecting a few extra wires, which permit toggling between 50/60hz modes and enabling/disabling the onboard CIC chip using 
              specific controller combinations. The status of the CIC chip is stored in flash RAM until it's modified for subsequent boots. However, the video mode defaults to its native 50hz upon 
              startup (though this can be altered). This software was developed for the Atmega 168P / 328P microcontroller, changes are easily made using the debug printouts in a development 
              environment.</p>

              <br>
            </a>
            <p>I wanted the ability to sniff the PS1 communications BUS to detect button presses. While the existing code for a different microcontroller worked well, I found it somewhat convoluted 
              for its purpose. I developed my own version using an LGT8F328P microcontroller and implemented a bit-banging algorithm to monitor the comms BUS. The code is concise, easily readable, 
              and adjustments can be made effortlessly using the debug printouts in a development environment. This setup enables the use of two reset combinations available on the Xstation Optical drive Emulator: 
              a short reset for games and a long reset to return to the game selection menu.</p>

            <p>After a class introduced us to some fundamentalsâ€”specifically, how to hide and show a flex box cardâ€”I realised that was all I needed to develop a memory game. Utilising the principles 
              taught in that session, I crafted a game that features various difficulty levels and a timer indicating how many attempts remain before it's game over. Admittedly, it might be a tad 
              challenging right now, and it's possibly a bit unfair that it doesn't reveal the second card selection on a failed attempt. But, the foundational framework is all in place!</p>

            <p>I repurposed someone elses code so I could wire it into an N64 console and use button combinations to trigger a reset to return to a game selection menu. It's not perfect,
              there are phantom presses sometimes. I think the controller line needs buffering. The console uses a single line communication protocol.

                        <br>
                      </a>
                      <p>For this challenge, we were tasked with choosing an API and learning how to use it. Our group, consisting of three members, selected the Spotify API. The core functionality of the 
                        application was developed by me, Lionel Sanderson. I set a personal challenge to avoid using any global variables, and I succeeded. However, another member introduced one at a later 
                        stage for reasons that remain unclear. The feature allowing users to shortlist their favorite artists was contributed by Jake. He also added the finishing touches, incorporating various 
                        effects and selecting the color schemes. The original README was authored by Michael.
                        The application operates in a series of steps. First, it verifies a legitimate user by sending account credentials; in response, the API issues a temporary token valid upon authentication. 
                        This token, along with other variables, is relayed from one function to another and repeatedly sent back to the API for validation with each request. Users can select an artist, which the 
                        application then translates from the searched name into the unique Spotify artist ID. Subsequently, the top 10 songs of that artist can be retrieved. If the artist has made preview snippets 
                        available, these can also be sampled. Due to Spotify's reliance on IDs instead of names to identify artists, there's a "similar artists" dropdown on the left, this was capped to 10 similar 
                        artists. This aids users in pinpointing the exact artist they're searching for, especially when artist names can be tricky, such as searching for "pink" when the correct name is "p!nk".</p>

                    The app essentially stores notes on the server-side. Unlike local storage, which, true to its name, confines the user to local storage, this app saves information 
                    (structured as a JS Object) on a server. It operates similarly to a cloud service, and users cannot delete the information unless specific code for deletion is implemented. 
                    In this instance, the code has been set up to both add and remove notes. Often, in practical scenarios, you wouldn't permit users to delete certain information (e.g., product reviews). 
                    A significant advantage of server storage is its global accessibility. The application is live and links can be found in the repository, though it may require multiple refreshes to 
                    activate it.</p>

                <p>This application serves as a daily planner. The "past" hours of the day are colored grey, the "present" hour is colored red, and the "future" hours are colored green. 
                  Notes are saved locally and can be retrieved upon reopening the application. The main challenge was colour-coding the time slots. I devised a function to compare the time slots 
                  against the current time of day and utilised that function as a parameter in another function.</p>

            The project was a collaborative effort involving a team of four. I conceived the initial idea, initiated the boilerplate, and handled the application setup and configuration. 
            My contributions included features like live bidding without the need for a refresh and other dynamic elements. I also addressed several bugs and assisted with other features.

                      High scores include the number of questions answered correctly, along with the time left when you finished the quiz. You suffer a penalty on your time left
                      when answering incorrectly, but it's coded to allow multiple attempts on the same question</p>
